# Monash EAE Data Analysis in Earth Sciences

## Description

This is the site accompanying the 2-week intensive for research students in the Monash University School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment. The course description is:
 
> Techniques for handling, analysing and presenting data in Earth Sciences using Python. Students will use real-world data provided to them or from their own research. The analysis component will include standard techniques such as correlations, power spectra, regridding and curve-fitting.

The practical goal of the intensive is to have students gain confidence in handling and plotting their own data in Python. The in-person aspect to this intensive is 9 days of 2-hour workshops where we go through the tutorials and solve any bugs collaboratively. 

The aim is to save students all the time I spent learning how to make nice figures so they can use it thinking about science instead! Students will leave with the ability to reproducibly generate figures like this:
