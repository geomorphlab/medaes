# Day 1

Today we will do introductions, get our software environment set up, and make our first plot!

## Overview
The course description is,
> Techniques for handling, analysing and presenting data in Earth Sciences using Python. Students will use real-world data provided to them or from their own research. The analysis component will include standard techniques such as correlations, power spectra, regridding and curve-fitting.
The plan is to have you feel confident to make publication-ready figures in Python with your own data. 

## Installations

### Python
Python is the coding language we'll use in this intensive; some computers come with Python on them, others don't.

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### pip
Pip is software that allows you to install Python packages easily; we need to install it.

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

### Jupyter Labs
Jupyter Labs is a console we use to code; we need to install it.

[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

### NumPy
NumPy is a Python package that lets us do maths; we need to install it.

[https://numpy.org/install/](https://numpy.org/install/)
```
pip install numpy
```

### pandas
pandas is a Python package that lets us work with tabulated data; we need to install it.

[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
```
pip install pandas
```

### matplotlib
matplotlib is a Python package that lets us plot data; we need to install it.

[https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## First notebook

See the first notebook [here](https://github.com/geomorphlab/medaes/blob/gh-pages/day1/day1.ipynb).

## Homework

Make an equivalent notebook to the one above where you ingest your own spreadsheet and plot some data from it.

To open Jupyter Labs just type `jupyter-lab` into your terminal. It will open up a console in a tab on your browser.
