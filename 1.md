# Day 1

## Overview
The course description is:
> Techniques for handling, analysing and presenting data in Earth Sciences using Python. Students will use real-world data provided to them or from their own research. The analysis component will include standard techniques such as correlations, power spectra, regridding and curve-fitting.

Today we will do introductions, get our software environment set up, and make our first plot!
